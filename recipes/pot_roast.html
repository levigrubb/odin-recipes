		<li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 carrots, chopped</li>

		<li>2 cups beef broth</li>
		<li>1 cup red wine (optional)</li>

	<h3>Instructions</h3>
	<ol>
		<li><strong>Preheat the oven:</strong>Prehead your oven to 325<sup>o</sup>F (160<sup>o</sup>C).</li>
		<li><strong>Prepare the beef:</strong>Pat the beef roast dry with paper towels. Season it generously with salt and pepper on all sides.</li>
		<li><strong>Sear the beef:</strong> Heat the olive oil in a large oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the beef roast and sear it until browned on all sides, about 3-4 minutes per side. Remove the beef from the pot and set it aside.</li>
		<li><strong>Cook the aromatics:</strong> In the same pot, add the chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped carrots, and chopped celery. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
		<li><strong>Deglaze the pot:</strong> Pour in the beef broth and red wine (if using), scraping the bottom of the pot to loosen any browned bits. Stir in the tomato paste until well combined.</li>
		<li><strong>Add herbs and beef:</strong> Tie the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves together with kitchen twine to make a bouquet garni. Place the bouquet garni and the seared beef roast back into the pot.</li>
		<li><strong>Slow cook:</strong> Cover the pot with a lid and transfer it to the preheated oven. Allow the roast to cook for about 3-4 hours, or until the beef is fork-tender and falls apart easily.</li>
		<li><strong>Add vegetables:</strong> About 1 hour before the roast is done, add the potato and carrot chunks to the pot. Continue cooking until the vegetables are tender and the beef is fully cooked.</li>
		<li><strong>Serve:</strong> Once the roast is onde, remove it from the pot and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing. Serve the pot roast slices with the vegetables and some of the cooking liquid as gravy.</li>
		<li><strong>Enjoy:</strong> Enjoy your delicious slow-cooked pot roast with your favorite sides!</li>
